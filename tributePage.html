                <li>The advent of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) changed the face of  the  history of <br>mankind in a manner that this world has never seen before</li>
                <li>At age 40, he began to have revelations from Allah that<br> became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam.</li>
                <li>Muhammad was born around 570, AD in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia).</li>
                <li>In his early 20s, Muhammad began working for a wealthy merchant woman named Khadijah, 15 years his senior</li>
                <li>Muhammad was also very religious, occasionally taking journeys of devotion to sacred sites near Mecca.<br> On one of his pilgrimages in 610, he was meditating in a cave on Mount Jabal aI-Nour.</li>
                <li>The Angel Gabriel appeared and relayed the word of God: “Recite in the name of your Lord who creates,<br> creates man from a clot! Recite for your lord is most generous….” These words became the opening verses of sūrah (chapter) 96 of the Qur'an.</li>
                <li>Between 624 and 628, the Muslims were involved in a series of battles for their survival. <br>In the final major confrontation, The Battle of the Trench and Siege of Medina, Muhammad and his followers prevailed and a treaty was signed.</li>
                <li>Muhammad gave amnesty to many of the Meccan leaders who had opposed him and pardoned many others.<br>Most of the Meccan population converted to Islam.</li>
                <li>After the conflict with Mecca was finally settled, Muhammad took his first true Islamic pilgrimage to that city and in March, 632, he delivered his last sermon at Mount Arafat.Upon his return to Medina to his wife’s home,he fell ill for several days. He died on June 8, 632, at the age of 62,and was buried at al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) one of the first mosques built by Muhammad in Medina. </li>
